This is a "personal" template created for a thesis to be submitted at IITG. 


It is modified from the following template:

https://nowsimplified.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/iit-guwahati-eee-phd-thesis-template/ 

How to use it:

1. Install texlive on your system. 

For IITG students, you can access it from CSEA Repository.

Currently it is hosted here: http://172.16.24.250/index.php?dir=Latex%20Miktek%20TexLive%20Style%20Files/

Note that this address may change in future.

2. If any sty file is missing, you can download it save it in directory where "IITG_Thesis.tex" is kept.

3. Some sty files can be found in "Missing_Styles" folder. They were missing from my tex installation.

4. This is tested only on Linux platform.

5. If you do not understand step 1 and 2 and you are getting an error regarding some .sty file missing, then copy the contents of "Missing_Styles" directory into the directory where "IITG_Thesis.tex" is kept. It might solve the problem.
