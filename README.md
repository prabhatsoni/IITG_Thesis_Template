This is a "personal" template created for a thesis to be submitted at IITG. 


It is modified from the following template:

https://nowsimplified.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/iit-guwahati-eee-phd-thesis-template/ 

How to use it:

1. Install texlive on your system. 

For IITG students, you can access it from CSEA Repository.

Currently it is hosted here: http://172.16.24.250/index.php?dir=Latex%20Miktek%20TexLive%20Style%20Files/

Note that this address may change in future.

2. If any sty file is missing, you can download it and save in "Styles" directory and change its path in \usepackage command.

3. The current contents of "Styles" directory are the files which were missing from my tex installation. Make changes accordingly for your system. 

4. This is tested only on Linux platform.
